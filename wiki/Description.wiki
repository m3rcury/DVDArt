= Introduction =

DVDArt is a new plugin that scrapes fanart.tv for DVD cover art for you movie collection in MovingPictures.


= Details =

The data driving the scraper is taken from MovingPictures, hence any corrections, (mainly missing IMDb IDs) need to be corrected in MovingPictures.

Images are downloaded from Fanart.tv site. I recommend that you visit site and help out by uploading any DVD images you might have/come across so that we all enrich its content, resulting in scraper finding more images to download.

- Movies with DVDArt shows movies which scraper successfully downloaded an image.
- Importer shows movies whose DVDArt is currently being imported.
- Movies missing DVDArt shows movies which scraper could not find any images.
