= Introduction =

DVDArt is a new plugin that scrapes fanart.tv for DVD cover art for you movie collection in MovingPictures.


= Details =

The data driving the scraper is taken from MovingPictures, hence any corrections, (mainly missing IMDb IDs) need to be corrected in MovingPictures.

Images are downloaded from Fanart.tv site. I recommend that you visit site and help out by uploading any DVD images you might have/come across so that we all enrich its content, resulting in scraper finding more images to download.


=* Movies with DVDArt shows movies which scraper successfully downloaded an image.

=* Importer shows movies whose DVDArt is currently being imported.

=* Movies missing DVDArt shows movies which scraper could not find any images.


The import function for new movies executes automatically in the background, so you don't need to trigger it manually.

Each tab has a number of functions which can be triggered by pressing the right mouse button. In Movies with DVDArt tab, pressing right mouse button gives the facility to Refresh DVDArt from Online. This option download all images available and allows you to change the existing image chosen. In Importer tab, pressing the right mouse button will Restart the Importer, hence if changes were done in MovingPictures, you don't need to restart application. In Movies missing DVDArt tab, the right mouse button presents 2 options. The first one sends the currently selected movie to the importer, which the second sends all the movies missing DVDArt to the importer.
